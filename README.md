# multiplicative-persistence
Inspired by this YT video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ
Also potentially code approach from this repo: https://kmcelwee.medium.com/multiplicative-persistence-is-solved-1937692b26cc

## Motivation

All the approaches I've seen so far are Python based and in some cases recursive, which likely won't scale/perform as optimally as possible. 
Curious if a semi-naive approach with some insights from the afore mentioned sources leveraging parallelism in faster languages could possibly look into the problem beyond the current number space.
